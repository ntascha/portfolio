# Website About me
This is a website dedicated to showcasing information about me, my skills, and my passion for web development. Below, you will find a brief guide on how to get started with the website.

## Getting Started
To run the website locally, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository to your local system.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the project's directory. 
4. Run ```npm install``` to install the required dependencies.
5. Start the development server by running ```npm run dev```.
6. Use a live server extension in your code editor to open the live server and automatically reload the website as you make changes.

## Code and Technologies Used
The website is built using HTML, CSS, and the Tailwind CSS framework. HTML is used to structure the content, while CSS is responsible for styling and layout. Tailwind CSS provides a utility-first approach, enabling rapid development and easy customization of the website's design. The use of Tailwind CSS ensures a responsive and visually appealing website.
